# RAG-Chatbot
This is an application of RAG principles to allow LLMs to reply to domain-specific questions.

# Remarks
For the original application it was used AWS to establish a connection to its foundational LLMs (Bedrock) so that text pre-processing and tokenization could be done through Amazon Titan Text and additional LLMs could be used to generate the answer in natural language.
